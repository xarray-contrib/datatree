DataTree
========

Creating a DataTree
-------------------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   DataTree

Tree Attributes
---------------

Attributes relating to the recursive tree-like structure of a ``DataTree``.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   DataTree.parent
   DataTree.children
   DataTree.name
   DataTree.path
   DataTree.root
   DataTree.is_root
   DataTree.is_leaf
   DataTree.subtree
   DataTree.siblings
   DataTree.lineage
   DataTree.ancestors
   DataTree.groups

Data Contents
-------------

Interface to the data objects (optionally) stored inside a single ``DataTree`` node.
This interface echoes that of ``xarray.Dataset``.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   DataTree.dims
   DataTree.sizes
   DataTree.data_vars
   DataTree.coords
   DataTree.attrs

   DataTree.indexes
   DataTree.chunks
   DataTree.nbytes
   DataTree.ds
   DataTree.to_dataset
   DataTree.has_data
   DataTree.has_attrs
   DataTree.is_empty

..

   Missing:
   ``DataTree.chunksizes``

Dictionary interface
--------------------

``DataTree`` objects also have a dict-like interface mapping keys to either ``xarray.DataArray``s or to child ``DataTree`` nodes.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   DataTree.__getitem__
   DataTree.__setitem__
   DataTree.__delitem__
   DataTree.update
   DataTree.get
   DataTree.items
   DataTree.keys
   DataTree.values

Tree Manipulation
-----------------

For manipulating, traversing, navigating, or mapping over the tree structure.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   DataTree.orphan
   DataTree.same_tree
   DataTree.relative_to
   DataTree.iter_lineage
   DataTree.find_common_ancestor

DataTree Contents
-----------------

Manipulate the contents of all nodes in a tree simultaneously.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

DataTree Node Contents
----------------------

Manipulate the contents of a single DataTree node.
